Feature: Minesweeper

'Cell [1-1] means row = 1, column = 1 (there is no column and row 0)

Cell without bomb -> O  
Cell with bomb -> X  
Cell revealed -> ,

Cell flagged with suspected bomb = !  
Cell flagged with suspected bomb but unsure about it = ?  
Cell flagged but cell with no mine = /

Cell with one adjacent bomb = 1  
Cell with two adjacent bomb = 2  
Cell with three adjacent bomb = 3  
Cell with four adjacent bomb = 4  
Cell with five adjacent bomb = 5  
Cell with six adjacent bomb = 6  
Cell with seven adjacent bomb = 7  
Cell with eight adjacent bomb = 8

3x3 Example with cell with bomb in the [2-2]  
Each dash means one row below it = OOO-OXO-OOO'

Background: 
Given the user opens the app

Scenario: Initial gamemap
Then the number of columns in the board should be: "8"
And the number of rows should be: "8"
And cells are all unreveled

#Should this scenario be in the initial gamemap or better by itself?
Scenario: Initial mines
Given the user starts the game
And the board is loaded
Then the board should have "10" hidden mines

Scenario: Untagged Mines left display
Then the mines left should show the following value: "10"

Scenario Outline: Time counter display
Then the time display should show the following value: "<timeCounter>"
When the user reveals cell [1-1]
Then time counter display should show the following value: "<display>"

Examples:
| timeDisplay | displayResult |
|             |       0       |
|       1     |       2       |
|      10     |      11       |
|     998     |     999       |

Scenario Outline: Time counter max number reached
Given the time counter should show the following value: "999"
Then the following value should show: "âˆž"

Scenario: Reset game
When the user uses reset the game button
Then mines left should show the following value: "10" 
And time display should show the following value: ""
And cells are all unreveled

Scenario: Tagging cell as mined
Given the user loads the following data: "OOO-OOO-OOO"
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value is: "10"
When the user tags cell [1-1]
Then cell [1-1] should show the following value: "!"
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value should be: 9

Scenario: Untagging cell as mined
Given the user loads the following data: "!OO-OOO-OOO"
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value is: "9"
When the user removes tags cell [1-1]
Then cell [1-1] should show the following value: ""
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value should be: "10"

Scenario: Tagging a questionable mine cell
Given "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value is: "10"
When the user tags on [2-2]
Then cell [2-2] should show the following value: "?"
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" display should be: "10"

Scenario: untagging a questionable mine cell
Given "<untaggedMinesLeft>" value is: "10"
When the user removes tag on [2-2]
Then cell [2-2] should show the following value: ""
And "<untaggedMinesLeft>" display should be: "10"

Scenario: Starting game with tag as first move
Given the game has not started
And user tags cell [2-2]
Then cell [2-2] should show the following value: "!"
And time counter should start

Scenario: Starting game with questionable tag as first move
Given the game has not started
And user tags cell [2-2]
Then cell [2-2] should show the following value: "?"
And time counter should start

Scenario: Negative tagged mines left 
Given the user loads the following data: "!!!-!!!-!!!-!!!"
Then "<untaggedMinesLeft>" display should be: "-2"

Scenario: Incorrect tag when user reveals cell with bomb
Given the user loads the following data: "OOO-!OO-XOX"
And user reveals cell [3-1]
Then game should be over
And the mockData should be: "OOO-/OO-XOX"

#Maybe too much work on my programming cause @When game is over ?    
Scenario: User game over
When the user loads the following data: "OOO-XXO-OXO"
Then time counter should be stopped
#Tagging example its okay?
And tagging should be disabled 
And cell [1-1] should be disabled
And cell [1-2] should be disabled
And cell [1-3] should be disabled
And cell [2-1] should be disabled and unreveled
And cell [2-2] should be disabled and unreveled
And cell [3-1] should be disabled
And cell [3-2] should be disabled and unreveled
And cell [3-3] should be disabled

Scenario: User defuses all mines -> User wins
Given the user loads the following data: "XXX-!OX-X!X"
And user reveals cell [2-2]
Then we should have the following data:  "!!!-36!-!3!"
And cells should be disabled
And timecounter should be stopped
And tagging should be disabled

#Is this scenario correct, or explained correctly?
Scenario: User trying to reveal a revealed cell
Given the user loads the following data: "1OO-XOO-1XO"
Then cell [2-2] should be disabled
And user tries to reveal cell [2-2]
Then nothing should happen
